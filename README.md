	<li><a href="https://github.com/AlexCouch/Device-Mod-Couch-Edition">Alex Couch's Refactored Device Mod</a> (experimental/academic purposes) by Alex Couch (obvi) - A refactored version of the device mod for academic purposes. It is mostly to test Alex's capabilities and learn as a programmer. It is refactored in a way to allow anyone to make a device with an API or an OS with a kernel, terminal, and drivers, or an application, which is not being touched as it is fine the way it is. Alex states that this should not be a replacement for cray's version. You should definitely stay up to date with cray's original version. This will be distributed for personal uses and will not be released anywhere but through personal copies (when a working version is available).</li>
